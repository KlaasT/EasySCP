3) Introduction
---------------
EasySCP delivers a complete hosting automation appliance by offering significant
security, total-cost-of-ownership, and performance advantages over competing
commercial solutions.

With EasySCP you can configure your server and applications, create user with
domains with a few point-and-click operations that take less than a minute.
There is no limit to the number of resellers, users and domains that can be
created. The core of EasySCP are 3 easy-to-use, web-based control panels. EasySCP
provides graphic user interfaces for the administrators, resellers and users.

================================================================================
4) SiteWide Mail protection solution
------------------------------------

Since EasySCP 1.1.0, both setup and update scripts are able to configure
a complete sitewide mail protection solution using Amavisd-new, SpamAssassin,
ClamAv and some other services such as razor...

If you want activate this solution, you should edit the easyscp.conf file before
install/update EasySCP to activate the services that are part of this
solution.

You can also disable the mail protection solution by setting the proper values
to 'no' in the easyscp.conf file (easyscp.old.conf when update), and by running
again the EasySCP update script.

See the comments in the easyscp.conf file for more information.

WARNING: Implementation of this solution is still experimental. You are warned!

3. install the required packages:

	First, update your distribution:
	# zypper dup
